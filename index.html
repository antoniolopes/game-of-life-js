					<p class="title">What is this?</p>
					<p>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a> 
						is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player
						game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
						In this simple Javascript implementation, you can interact with the Game of Life by creating an initial
						configuration and observing how it evolves.
					</p>
					<p class="title">What's the goal?</p>
					<p>
						There is no particular goal, other than to try to create visually-interesting cellular evolution processes.
						Given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Rules" target="_blank">rules of the game</a>,
						there are some specially-shapped sets of cells that have interesting behaviors.
						You can discover more about them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p class="title">How do I use it?</p>
					<p>
						To create the initial configuration simply click on specific
						areas of the canvas on the left to create living cells (represented by rounded-corners squares).
						Clicking on a living cell, will erase it.
						Once you're satisfied with your initial configuration, press the "Start" button and let the evolution begin.
						If you want to stop the evolution at any time, simply press the "Stop" button. To clear the canvas and start
						a new configuration, press the "Reset" button. If you don't know where to start, click the "Random" button
						and then the "Start" button.
